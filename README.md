# IMAGE CAPTIONING USING VIT-ENCODER AND GPT2 DECODER
## Clone this repository.
## Go to the 'caption-app' directory and run npm install, npm run and npm start. A react app will run on port 3000 and open in default browser, allow camera access.
## Go to the project root directory and run 'go run main.go'. A back-end service will run.
## Staying in the root directory run  'python3 app.py'. A python app for image captioning will run.
## Your browser now produces caption for images captured using webcam.
